## An Introduction

In "Real World The Game," you experience the game of a lifetime. Here are some key explanations for players:

### Setting

You are a financially struggling individual in New York City (located in Brazil) burdened with debts owed to different groups. You will pay off these debts by selling NFTs (digital images) using cryptocurrencies as currency to clients. You have 30 days (with 17 hours each day) to clear your debt.

#### The Game

The main objective of the game is to sell NFTs to pay off your debts.

**How Many Debts Do I Have To Pay?**

You have a total of 3 debts: IRS, Cartel, and Rent. Once you define the amount of money owed to each group, you start a new day to pay off the debt.

*Side Note:*
The IRS and the Cartel have a fixed total, while Rent accumulates daily.

**Cryptocurrency**

Cryptocurrency (crypto) is the in-game currency, and there are different types with varying values in USD.

**Example:**
| Crypto Type | Crypto Number | Crypto's Value in USD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bitcoin | 1 | 17,221.10 |
| Ethereum | 1 | 1,326.84 |
| Litecoin | 1 | 81.33 |
| Monero | 1 | 159.29 |

*Side Note:*
Crypto values change daily.

**Why Use Crypto In Game?**

Crypto is used because of NFTs, which are digital images that players can buy using crypto to gain ownership and help pay off their debt.

**Player Limit**

The game is designed without a fixed player limit, though playing solo is common. Adding more players is possible, and the objective remains the same: pay off debt.

## Materials

- A computer or phone (recommended)
- 3 D20 dice (or a single one)
- 2 six-sided dice (or a single one)
- Deck of playing cards
- A document (Google Doc or notepad with paper and pen)

### Why & How To Use These Materials In Game

You will use a computer or phone to find cryptocurrency-to-USD conversions.

The 3 D20 dice will determine the money owed. (One die can be reused.)

The 2 six-sided dice will determine NFT prices. (One die can be reused.)

A deck of playing cards will track your rent.

A notepad helps keep track of information.

---

## Rules

Each player starts with 3 D20s and a deck of playing cards. D20s indicate the money owed to various entities, which players must pay off while trying to become rich.

### The Introduction

Roll 2 of the 3 D20s, calculate the sum, double it, convert it to Bitcoin, and that's the IRS debt. Roll the remaining D20, triple it, convert it to Bitcoin, and that's the Cartel debt. Convert these totals to USD.

**Bank:** Where you store and withdraw money.

**Store:** A source for items.

### Rent

Remove the "Joker" card from the deck, shuffle it, draw 3 cards, sum the values, and that's your Ethereum-based rent.

---

## The Store

Purchase options:

| Day Unlocked | Item Name | Price | Benefit | Supply |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ANY DAY | Red Bull | 4 USD | 5 NFTs Buff | Infinite |
| ANY DAY | Monster | 3 USD | 3 NFTs Buff | Infinite |
| DAY 2 | Cell Phone | 150 USD | Useless Item | 1 in supply |
| DAY 4 | IPad | 500 USD | Halves NFT Production Time | 1 in supply |

Daily NFT production limit: 10 per day (without buffs).

---

## The Market

The Market is where you set up your NFTs for sale. You roll a die for each NFT to determine if it's bought.

### Rolling Charts

*First Roll:*

- Roll Number 1-3: Purchase Failed
- Roll Number 4-6: Purchase Passed

*Second Roll:*

- Roll Number 1-3: Regular Price
- Roll Number 4-6: Price Doubled
